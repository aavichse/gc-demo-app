# GC Demo App 

gc-demo-app is a Helm chart that enables you to build an application
skeleton with interconnected components. The components can be configured
to request each other, with customizable roles and communication rules.  
This demo app allows you to define components, roles, and communication 
rules in the values.yaml file.
